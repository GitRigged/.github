# 🌀 Welcome to GitRigged

> *“In an infinite multiverse of commits, everything is rigged anyway.”* – Probably Rick

We’re a collective of nerds, coders, and learners who like to break things, learn stuff, and sometimes accidentally merge into the wrong branch.  

---

## 🔬 What We Do
- 🚀 Experiment with new tech (and occasionally blow it up)  
- 🧪 Build side projects that may or may not survive a merge conflict  
- 📚 Learn, share, and laugh at our mistakes  
- 🌀 Explore the infinite timelines of bad code and happy accidents  

---

## 📦 Our Repos
- **`rigged-docs`** → Docs, guides, memes  
- **`portal-pipelines`** → CI/CD experiments across the multiverse  
- **`meeseeks-scripts`** → Helper utilities (like “fix all the things!” scripts)  
- **`dimension-c137`** → Learning and play projects  

---

## 🛸 Our Vibes
- **Morty-level coding confidence** 😬  
- **Rick-level sarcasm** 🍾  
- **Meeseeks-level task completion** (sometimes)

## 🌀 Join the Multiverse
If you’re here, you’re probably already rigged.  
Grab a plumbus, open a PR, and let’s break some timelines together.
