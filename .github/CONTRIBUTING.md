Thanks for wanting to help (you beautiful Meeseeks)!

## How to contribute
1. Fork or branch off `main`.
2. Use conventional commits if possible.
3. Keep PRs small, focused, and memeworthy.
4. Add tests or docs when it makes sense.

## Local Setup
- Use a recent LTS for your language of choice.
- Lint before pushing.
- Be kind to CI. Itâ€™s already rigged.
